            <p>Time for a little history lesson.</p>
            <p>AstroCope Studios was created on a whim on 5th March 2024, It was an idea proposed by me (Astro) to my pal (Cope_)</p>
            <p>This website is intended to share our games we create!</p>
            <p>PS. The name we chose was very lazy i know.</p>
