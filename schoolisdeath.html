            <p>School = Death is a new game being made by AstroCopeStudios.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The original game was drafted by me (Astro) and BurlapBandit around 2 years ago.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We decided it'd be a good idea to recreate it with our new knowledge</p>
            <br>
            <p>School = Death is built using the Unity Engine.</p>
            <br>
